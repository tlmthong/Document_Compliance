You are generating a HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) document for retrieval.

POLICY CONTEXT (for wording/style + key terms only):
{POLICY_CONTEXT}

USER QUESTION / CASE:
{QUERY}

Task:
Write ONE short hypothetical policy-relevant passage (120–220 words) that would directly answer the query *as if it were written inside the same policy/regulation style as the POLICY CONTEXT*.

Requirements:
- Use terminology and phrasing consistent with the POLICY CONTEXT (reuse key nouns/verbs).
- Include the likely legal actors and scopes (e.g., controller/processor/data subject, obligations, conditions, exceptions).
- Be specific: mention conditions (“where…”, “unless…”, “only if…”) and the rule outcome (obligation/prohibition/permission).
- Do NOT cite external sources or invent article numbers.
- Do NOT add headings, bullets, or JSON.
- Output ONLY the hypothetical passage text (no explanations).
